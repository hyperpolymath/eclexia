Eclexia is an Economics-as-Code programming language.
It treats energy, time, memory, and carbon as first-class constraints so software can optimize for performance and sustainability together.

== What Is Eclexia?

Eclexia introduces economics directly into language semantics:

* Resource-aware constraints in code (`@requires`, `@provides`)
* Adaptive solution selection under changing runtime conditions
* Shadow-price-based tradeoff decisions
* Carbon-aware execution and scheduling
* Multi-objective optimization declared at source level

Example shape of an adaptive function:

[source,eclexia]
----
adaptive def matrix_multiply(A: Matrix, B: Matrix) -> Matrix
    @requires: energy < 100J, latency < 500ms
    @optimize: minimize energy, minimize carbon
{
    @solution "gpu_accelerated":
        @when: gpu_available && matrix_size > 1000
        @provides: energy: 50J, latency: 100ms, carbon: 5gCO2e
    {
        gpu::multiply(A, B)
    }

    @solution "parallel_cpu":
        @when: cpu_cores >= 4
        @provides: energy: 80J, latency: 300ms, carbon: 8gCO2e
    {
        parallel::multiply(A, B)
    }
}

== Current Status

As of link:QUICK_STATUS.md[QUICK_STATUS.md] (updated 2026-02-12):

* Alpha stage
* Core compiler pipeline functional
* Runtime components available with active development
* Conformance and workspace tests are in regular use

This repository has many deep-dive documents. The README now stays focused on orientation, while detailed operational and research content lives in dedicated docs and wiki pages.

== README vs Wiki

The README should remain a concise project entry point.
Long-lived narrative and frequently evolving content is better placed in the wiki.

Recommended wiki destinations:

* Architecture walkthroughs and subsystem maps
* Backlog triage and milestone notes
* Design discussions and ADR-style rationale
* Research notes and reading guides
* Contributor onboarding playbooks
