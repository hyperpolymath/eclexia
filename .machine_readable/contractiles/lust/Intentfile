future:
  trust-engine:
    - "Replace pending Trustfile key/signature placeholders with operational key material."
    - "Add automated trustfile integrity verification in CI release jobs."

  security-and-analysis:
    - "Keep Hypatia scanning active on pull requests and scheduled runs."
    - "Keep panic-attack scanning in the local and CI quality loop."
    - "Escalate critical/high findings to blocking status until remediated."

  quality-gates:
    - "Preserve unit, conformance, integration, p2p, and e2e test gates in Mustfile/Justfile."
    - "Maintain benchmark smoke checks and publish reproducible benchmark snapshots."

  boundary-purity:
    - "Enforce Zig-only FFI sources under ffi/."
    - "Enforce Idris2-only ABI definitions under src/abi/."
    - "Grow ABI/FFI through additive extension APIs while preserving stable symbol compatibility."

  proven-reinforcement:
    - "Use proven/Idris2 for critical-path reinforcement, not blanket language migration."
    - "Prioritize safety-sensitive surfaces first (safe crypto/path/url/json/network and ABI invariants)."
    - "Retain Rust and other practical languages for non-critical implementation where this improves delivery and operability."

  documentation:
    - "Keep machine_read and machine_readable documents synchronized with implementation status."
    - "Keep human-readable docs and wiki pages in sync with actual command behavior and maturity state."
