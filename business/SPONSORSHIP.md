# Eclexia Sponsorship Guide

## Objective
Set up recurring project funding using:
- GitHub Sponsors
- Open Collective

This document defines account setup, tiers, messaging, and reporting cadence.

## 1. GitHub Sponsors Setup
### 1.1 Prerequisites
- Organization account with verified maintainers.
- Public funding statement and roadmap links.
- Bank/tax identity details prepared.

### 1.2 Configuration Checklist
1. Enable GitHub Sponsors for the project/org.
2. Add a clear sponsor profile:
- Mission statement (economics-as-code for resource-aware software).
- Funding usage breakdown (engineering, docs, ecosystem, security).
- Public milestones and progress signals.
3. Define monthly tiers:
- Individual supporter tier(s).
- Team/organization supporter tier(s).
- Strategic sponsor tier with advisory sessions.
4. Add `FUNDING.yml` so sponsor links appear across the repository.

### 1.3 Suggested Tier Framework
- $10/mo: Supporter (name listed in monthly thanks).
- $50/mo: Early updates + roadmap briefings.
- $250/mo: Team supporter + quarterly office-hours invite.
- $1,000+/mo: Strategic sponsor + integration advisory call.

## 2. Open Collective Setup
### 2.1 Why Open Collective
- Transparent budgeting and expense tracking.
- Supports organizational contributors and fiscal flows.

### 2.2 Configuration Checklist
1. Create collective and governance policy.
2. Define contribution categories:
- Individual backers.
- Company sponsors.
- Grants/institutional support.
3. Publish budget categories:
- Engineering
- Documentation
- Outreach
- Infrastructure
4. Define expense approval workflow and SLAs.

## 3. Funding Messaging
### 3.1 Core Sponsor Narrative
- Eclexia makes resource economics executable in software.
- Sponsor support accelerates open infrastructure for accountable computing.
- Funding produces publicly visible milestones and technical deliverables.

### 3.2 What Sponsors Enable
- Toolchain hardening and ecosystem libraries.
- Public playground and onboarding quality.
- Security and reliability maintenance.
- Academic and industry collaboration outputs.

## 4. Reporting Cadence
- Monthly: short sponsor update (shipped items, metrics, next month).
- Quarterly: roadmap review (progress vs commitments, risks, re-prioritization).
- Annual: impact report (technical, adoption, financial transparency).

## 5. Governance and Ethics
- Maintain open-source-first posture for core language/runtime.
- Do not grant product-direction veto rights tied solely to donation size.
- Document conflicts of interest and decision records for major sponsorships.

## 6. Immediate Next Actions
1. Create `.github/FUNDING.yml` with GitHub Sponsors + Open Collective links.
2. Publish first sponsor profile with explicit 12-month goals.
3. Launch sponsor tiers and announce via website/community channels.
4. Start monthly reporting cadence from the first sponsored month.
