= Eclexia Pitch Deck (Draft)

== Slide 1: Title
- Eclexia
- Economics-as-Code for resource-aware software
- Date: February 11, 2026

== Slide 2: The Core Problem
- Software teams optimize latency and throughput but ignore full resource economics.
- Cloud spend and carbon costs are rising faster than governance maturity.
- Existing tools observe after the fact; they do not enforce constraints in code.

== Slide 3: Why Existing Approaches Fail
- Monitoring dashboards are reactive, not preventative.
- Sustainability metrics are detached from engineering decisions.
- Cost controls are policy docs, not executable guarantees.

== Slide 4: The Eclexia Approach
- Language-native resource constraints.
- Adaptive functions with explicit trade-offs.
- Runtime that tracks and reports resource dimensions.
- Shadow prices to drive economically rational execution.

== Slide 5: Product Demonstration Narrative
- Define a function with energy/carbon budget.
- Provide multiple implementations with different trade-offs.
- Runtime selects viable/optimal path under current shadow prices.
- Output includes budget adherence and carbon-aware behavior.

== Slide 6: Technology Architecture
- Compiler pipeline (parse/type-check/HIR/MIR/backends).
- Runtime crates: core runtime, async, carbon, shadow.
- Planned web playground for zero-install onboarding.

== Slide 7: Market Opportunity
- FinOps + GreenOps + platform engineering convergence.
- Climate disclosure and sustainability commitments increase demand.
- Resource governance for AI and high-throughput systems is under-served.

== Slide 8: Initial Beachheads
- Public sector and research institutions.
- Industrial and IoT platforms with energy/carbon constraints.
- Enterprise platform teams with strict SLO and cost targets.

== Slide 9: Business Model
- Open-source core with commercial services.
- Enterprise support contracts.
- Hosted analytics/control plane.
- Training and certification programs.

== Slide 10: Go-to-Market
- Developer-first open ecosystem.
- Pilot programs with measurable baseline/after metrics.
- Partnerships with universities and sustainability-focused engineering orgs.

== Slide 11: Traction and Progress
- Compiler/runtime test coverage and conformance harness in place.
- Carbon/shadow runtime modules implemented and verified.
- Documentation corpus and tutorial set active.
- Immediate roadmap: playground + ecosystem tooling.

== Slide 12: Roadmap (12 Months)
- Q1-Q2: Playground and onboarding, core toolchain hardening.
- Q2-Q3: Section 21 ecosystem acceleration (tools/frameworks/libraries).
- Q3-Q4: Pilot deployments, hosted metrics and policy workflows.

== Slide 13: Team and Execution
- Technical leadership in PL/runtime and systems architecture.
- Contributor model for ecosystem expansion.
- Research-to-product strategy with measurable milestones.

== Slide 14: Funding Ask
- Funding for 12-month execution runway.
- Target use of funds:
  - Product engineering
  - Developer relations + docs
  - Pilot integration support
- Desired outcomes:
  - Production pilots
  - Measurable cost/carbon reduction case studies

== Slide 15: Closing
- Eclexia makes resource economics executable.
- We are building the language and runtime layer for accountable software.
