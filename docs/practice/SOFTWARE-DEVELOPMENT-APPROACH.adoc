= Software Development Approach (General)
:toc: left
:toclevels: 2

This is the general operating policy for software development across repositories.

== Core Sequence

Always run work in this order:

1. Scope first (Axis 1)
2. Maintenance second (Axis 2)
3. Audit third (Axis 3)

== Axis Definitions

=== Axis 1: Scope

Priority order: `must > intend > like`

Axis 1 output is a scoped assembly of work based on:

* README, roadmap, status, CI/security docs
* marker scans (`TODO`, `FIXME`, `XXX`, `HACK`, `STUB`, `PARTIAL`)
* Idris unsoundness scan when Idris exists (`believe_me`, `assert_total`)
* docs honesty check (intent vs actual implementation)

=== Axis 2: Maintenance

Priority order: `corrective > adaptive > perfective`

* Corrective: fix defects, regressions, breakage, security/safety failures
* Adaptive: reconcile scope changes, remove stale references, cull obsolete work
* Perfective: improve quality/clarity/performance only from the honest Axis 1 state

=== Axis 3: Audit

Priority order: `systems > compliance > effects`

* Systems: required mechanisms exist and are operating
* Compliance: seams/compromises/exceptions are explicit, bounded, and do not drift
* Effects: benchmark and operational impact evidence is captured and reviewed

Compliance scanner baseline: `panic-attack` +
Effects/ecological baseline: sustainabot-guided ecological checking

== Generic Cleanup And Finish-Off

At cycle end:

* reduce root clutter to required control/entry files
* archive/remove stale or superseded work
* synchronize human and machine docs
* run compliance and effects audits with evidence capture
* produce Must/Should/Could summary and immediate next-actions list

== Collaboration Rule

Effects review must include explicit maintainer dialogue:

* what changed
* why it changed
* what risks remain
