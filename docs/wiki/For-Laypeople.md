# Eclexia for Laypeople

## What Problem Is Eclexia Solving?

Most software is written for features first and resource impact later.
Eclexia makes resource impact part of the program itself.

That means developers can describe goals like:

- use less energy
- keep latency low
- reduce carbon impact

and let the runtime make better choices automatically.

## Why This Matters

- Better battery life for mobile and edge software
- Lower operating cost in cloud and server workloads
- Smaller carbon footprint when workloads can shift in time or strategy

## What Makes It Different

- It treats resource constraints as language-level concepts
- It includes economic tradeoff logic in runtime decisions
- It combines programming language design with sustainability goals

## Is It Production Ready?

Not yet. It is an alpha project with real working components and active development.
