# FAQ

## Is Eclexia production ready?

No. It is currently alpha with active development.

## Why is most code Rust, not Eclexia?

That is normal for an early language implementation. Self-hosting and broader dogfooding increase Eclexia source share over time.

## Is there formal verification work?

Yes. Coq/Agda artifacts exist, with some remaining admitted theorems still in progress.

## Where should I start as a contributor?

Use [For Developers](For-Developers.md), then read `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `QUICK_STATUS.md`.

## How do I evaluate performance claims?

Treat claims as evolving until benchmark suites and reproducible benchmark reports are complete and regularly published.
