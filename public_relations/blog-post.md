## Structure

### Opening Hook (2-3 paragraphs)

```markdown
Software is responsible for 2-4% of global carbon emissions—more than the
entire aviation industry. Yet when developers write code, they have no idea
how much energy they're consuming, what their carbon footprint is, or whether
there's a more efficient way to accomplish the same task.

What if that changed? What if your programming language automatically tracked
energy consumption, optimized for battery life, and helped you write greener
code—without you having to think about it?

Today, we're introducing Eclexia: the first programming language where
sustainability is a first-class concern, not an afterthought.

### The Problem (3-4 paragraphs)

```markdown
## The Hidden Cost of Code

Every line of code you write has a real-world impact:

**Energy consumption.** Running software requires electricity. Data centers
consume massive amounts of power, mobile apps drain batteries, and cloud
computing costs are spiraling out of control.

**Carbon emissions.** That electricity often comes from fossil fuels. A single
ML training run can emit as much CO2 as five cars over their entire lifetimes.

**Economic cost.** Companies spend millions optimizing cloud infrastructure
manually. Developers guess at which algorithms are most efficient. There's no
principled way to make cost/performance trade-offs.

**User experience.** Mobile users notice when apps drain their battery. They
delete power-hungry apps and leave 1-star reviews.

Yet traditional programming languages treat resources as infinite. There's no
`Energy` type. No way to say "this function must use less than 100 joules."
No automatic optimization for carbon footprint.

**We think that's backwards.**
