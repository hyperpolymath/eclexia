## Strategic Positioning

**Remember:** Eclexia's superpower is the **sustainability angle**. Lead with:
- 🌍 Climate impact (carbon tracking, green computing)
- 🔋 Battery life (mobile apps users love)
- 💰 Cost savings (cloud bills CFOs care about)

**Then** mention the technical excellence (type system, zero-cost abstractions, etc.)

**Trojan horse strategy:** Come for sustainability, stay for excellent language design.
